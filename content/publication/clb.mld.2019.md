abstract = "This study identified engagement profiles among middle school students (N= 1125) in science, based on aglobal, behavioral, cognitive, and affective dimensions of engagement. The relationships between engagementprofiles and key motivation predictors (science achievement goal orientations and self-efficacy) and studentachievement in science were also examined. Latent profile analysis revealedfive distinct science engagementprofiles, including Moderately Engaged, Moderately Disengaged, Disengaged, Behaviorally Engaged, andBehaviorally Disengaged. Controlling for grade, gender, and minority status, results showed that mastery or-ientation and self-efficacy significantly predicted the likelihood of membership in profiles characterized byhigher engagement in science. As expected, the Moderately Engaged and Behaviorally Engaged profiles wereassociated with higher achievement in science, and the reverse pattern was found for the Moderately Disengagedand Disengaged profiles. Our results support the utility of examining multidimensional engagement profiles, andthe implications of these profiles for students' motivation and learning in science are discussed."
